            <h3>Scattered</h3>
            <p>
                I’m a little stumped to be honest. The last post came so naturally, freely. This post feels a little more rigid, forced. There are so many things I want to say, but no words to say them. I have been feeling pretty strongly the last week or so. I can’t focus. I feel like a scatterbrain.<br/><br/>
                I work remotely for a financial technology company. In hopes of increasing out-of-office morale, our HR team has created a variety of ways to stay connected and learn about the people we work with. One of their efforts is a weekly info page on an individual in the company. Each week one person is chosen. They fill out a form with random information, and HR creates a page with the information where people can read about the outside work life of that person. <br/><br/>
                This week, I was selected. I agreed right away. I opened up the form. I had an idea of what questions might be asked based on the information from the previous employees’ pages. I began filling them out. Then came the question that changed everything: “If you could have coffee with anyone (dead or alive) it would be _________________ because _________________”. I stared at my screen for several moments. It hit me like a brick wall. I knew my answer, but I couldn’t write it down. I moved past it. Next up: “If you could tell your 12 year old self one thing, what would it be?” I lost it. <br/><br/>
                Mid-workday I found myself on my couch uncontrollably crying as I looked through old scrapbooks that Marisa had made with Kyla and I. My whole self ached. My heart hurt. It felt as though it was sinking within my being. I waited for that storm to pass before I came back to my computer. <br/><br/>
                Simple things still trigger me. I am still hurting. I am still grieving. People forget that.  I think sometimes I even forget it myself, making it even easier for everyone else to forget, too. My only goal is to allow myself to feel my feelings and be honest.  But the inconsistency makes it challenging. <br/><br/>
                I suppose the reality of it all is just that: the feelings and emotions associated with grief aren’t consistent and they change over time. I don’t know why I expected things to be different, but I did. So now for the shift in my comprehension.<br/><br/>
                This is something I have been learning to do - shift, that is. I thought I had an idea of how this grief stuff was going to go. I figured I had it all laid out in my head: you spend a few weeks really grieving (which just looks like crying all the time);  then you move on to feeling ok and remembering the positive times. If you’ve experienced grief, I hope you’re laughing at me as much as I am. My conception of grief was so far off.  I am learning to shift my ideas of what grief is in hopes of removing those expectations. Doing this, opens my mind to the idea that I really don’t know what's going on and I am ok with that.<br/><br/>
                This all feels very scattered - just a random array of thoughts, feelings, emotions, statements. I suppose that’s where I am right now. Scattered.<br/><br/>
                As Marisa would say, always be kind and remember to smile.
