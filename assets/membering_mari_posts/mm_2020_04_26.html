            <h3>Always in my Heart</h3>
            <p>
                Sitting here in my home, social-distancing myself from the world, I have an exorbitant amount of time to think, to remember. To help me never forget anything about my beautiful baby sister, I have started this series: ‘membering Mari. On the monthly anniversary of her passing I will post to this series stories, memories, and characteristics of my little sister as well as steps I am taking in my own grieving process. I hope you learn something from her, laugh because of her, and never let yourself forget her. Shall we begin? <br/><br/>
                I feel it is only appropriate to start  with something that  best characterizes our relationship. This story is very near and dear to my heart. When Marisa was first diagnosed with cancer, she was only 14. I was 16. Given that she was a child (and had a heart transplant), Marisa received treatment at the BC Children’s Hospital in Vancouver, BC. In between treatments, she was to stay within a certain radius of the hospital at all times.  This meant she couldn’t come home to the island. I was in high school at the time attending classes and only able to visit my sister some weekends. I hated leaving her at the end of the weekend. I wanted to hold her hand through the intimidating treatment process. Before leaving each weekend I told her that if I wasn’t there when she was scared, she could always make a fist and know that I would be making one too, just like we were holding hands. It sounds sappy, but it worked for us. It was our way of connecting when we weren’t together. The more we used it, the more connected we became and after a period of time, we came up with this saying “No matter how far apart we are, you’ll always be in my heart.” <br/><br/>
                In November 2019, I realized that I wanted Marisa to understand how much I loved her. I wanted her to see how much I would do for her and what she meant to me, so I got our saying tattooed on my arm, but without telling her. One night in December I went to see her at my parents where she was staying in their care . I showed her my tattoo. That first time, and any other time she saw my tattoo, she cried. I knew then like I know now, she understood my love and that the feeling was mutual. <br/><br/>
                
                No matter how far apart we are, you will always be in my heart. I love you beautiful. 

                That’s it for today. As Marisa would say, always be kind and remember to smile.
