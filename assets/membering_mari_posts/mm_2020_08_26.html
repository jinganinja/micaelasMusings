            <h3>Importance</h3>
            <p>
                February 2019 - she was sick. We didn’t know why. Had you told me then, that my time with her was limited, I wouldn't have believed you. Less than a year later, she passed. <br/><br/>
                Initially, we thought she had a flu that just wouldn’t go away. She couldn’t keep food down. She was nauseous, dizzy. She was in the hospital, tests being done daily. All she wanted was to go home. Some part of me wonders if she knew. Could she have known? <br/><br/>
                Around the time Marisa got her second cancer diagnosis, she had been doing this very typical "Marisa-thing". She would text me and say something along the lines of, “We need to talk,” or “I have something really important to tell you”. I would drop everything and phone her right away, expecting an emergency. Instead, she would pick up the phone and talk nonchalantly about someone she had seen or something she bought. I think she did this three or four times before her second diagnosis. When I got that last  message saying, “Mic, I need to tell you something”, I responded, “Ris, I am just about to go into an interview. Can I call you after? If it’s an emergency I can call now.” <br/><br/>
                “It can wait.”<br/><br/>
                I should have known. When I arrived at the interview location, I glanced at my phone and saw a missed call from my dad.<br/><br/>
                Marisa - you are important. This time it was not something that could wait. I should have known.<br/><br/>
                I called my Dad... Brain tumour.  Her cancer was back. We cried. I told him I loved him and to tell her how much I loved her. I texted her. I canceled the interview. I called her. <br/><br/>
                Damn, I wish I could call her right now. Some things are so easy to take for granted.<br/><br/>
                I went to be with her. I wonder what went through her mind when she told me her news could wait. I wish I knew how she felt when I asked if it was important. I got it wrong.  Marisa was very important. I should’ve taken the time to call. <br/><br/>
                I think about that day. I think about that time in my life; that time in Marisa’s life. I wonder how much time in 2019 I would have spent with her without that day, that diagnosis. It scares me. We were 18 months apart in age. Even knowing we had each other's backs, we had our differences - differences that pushed us apart.<br/><br/>
                I suppose it just allows an opening in my mind for the relationships that do really matter to me: make them count.  Spend your time intentionally. Spend it how and  where you would spend it as if your time were limited, because it is. <br/><br/>
                As Marisa would say, always be kind and remember to smile.
