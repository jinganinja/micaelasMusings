                    As I sit here in my home, social-distancing myself from the world, I have found an exuberant amount of time to think, to remember. In hopes of never forgetting anything about my beautiful baby sister, I have started this series: ‘membering Mari. On the monthly anniversary of her passing I will post to this series stories, memories, and characteristics of my little sister as well as my grieving process. I hope you learn something from her, laugh because of her, and never let yourself forget her. Shall we begin? <br/><br/>
                    I feel it is only appropriate to start in a place that I feel is the best example of our relationship. This story is very near and dear to my heart. When Marisa was diagnosed with cancer the first time, she was only 14 and I was 16. Given that she was a child, she was to be treated at the BC Children’s Hospital in Vancouver, BC. Her treatment was completed at Children’s and she was to stay within a certain radius of the hospital at all times, which meant she couldn’t come home between treatments. I was in highschool at the time, and had to spend the week at home, but I would visit on the weekends whenever I could. I hated leaving her at the end of the weekend. I wanted to hold her hand through the intimidating treatment process. Before leaving each weekend I told her that if I wasn’t her when she was scared, she could always make a fist and know that I would be making one too, just like we were holding hands. It sounds sappy, but it worked for us. It was our way of connecting when we weren’t together. The more we used it, the more connected we became and after a period of time, we came up with this saying “No matter how far apart we are, you’ll always be in my heart.” <br/><br/>
                    In November 2019, I realized that I wanted Marisa to understand how much I loved her. I wanted her to see how much I would do for her and what she meant to me, so I got our saying tattooed on my arm, without telling her. One night in December I went to my parents to visit her (at that point she was living there under the care of my parents). I showed her my tattoo and that time and any other time she saw my tattoo she cried. I knew then like I know now, she understood and that the feeling was mutual. <br/><br/>
                    
                    No matter how far apart we are, you will always be in my heart. I love you beautiful. 
    
                    That’s it for today. As Marisa would say, always be kind and remember to smile.
