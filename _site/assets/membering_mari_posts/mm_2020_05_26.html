            <h3>Her Mother, My Mother, Our Mother’s Day Post</h3>
            <p>
                Our first Mother’s day without Ris....Watching my Mother care for Marisa was life-changing. My Mother has an innate ability to care for others and this shone through particularly in Marisa's last year.<br/><br/>
                Marisa always preferred Mom's assistance when needed. She always wanted to be near our Mother when she was scared. She shared her most vulnerable feelings with her. My mother’s strength may have wavered in her private moments but it was rock solid when she was by Marisa's side  in the hospital room and later at our family home. <br/><br/>
                It wasn’t only in the last year of Marisa’s life that our Mom was her rock. Marisa had  years of challenges. From innumerable medical trips to BC Children’s Hospital to high school "social drama", my Mom had Marisa’s back, always supporting and advocating for her. I have watched it all and can honestly say I didn’t always agree with it in the moment.   However, hindsight makes me wish I had supported my sister more. <br/><br/>
                Mom, you gave so much of yourself for her. Without you as loving Mom-advocate, what would her life have been like? How much harder would it have been for her?   Without you, would the last months of having Marisa at home been possible?  Do you know how much Marisa adored you?  You were her number 1 fan, her cheerleader, her rock, her guide. Thank you.  Even if the rest of us put in all our time and effort,  we could never have done what you have in the last year especially.<br/><br/>
                I love you, Mom,  more than words can say. <br/><br/>
                When Marisa was in the hospital, there was a period of time when her legs were super-sensitive to touch or movement.  Excruciating pain resulted from the lightest touch. Many times, Marisa accused Mom of bumping her leg or foot in passing, despite the intentional space our Mom would leave. Marisa then would say something like “You boonie butt head!!” or, "Watch out or I will give you a knuckle sandwich!”  Then she'd laugh. She had quirky ways of showing her love.<br/><br/>
                Not only has my Mom supported Marisa in every way possible, she has, also, lovingly supported every one of us kids. I hope, Mom, you see the difference you made for all of us.<br/><br/>
                She has checked in with each of us regularly (if you aren’t aware, there are 8 of us). Despite her personal grief, she has taken into consideration each of our own grieving processes. This will never cease to amaze me.  Some days it’s hard for me to even consider my dog’s needs yet alone think beyond  that.  At the end of the day, Marisa and I were and are blessed with the gift of you, Mom. <br/><br/>
                Happy Mother’s Day, Momma. You continue to live a life of love, care, compassion, and laughter - a life that impacts each and every one of your children and grandchildren and a life that especially enriched the last months in Marisa's life. <br/><br/>
                As Marisa would say, always be kind and remember to smile.
