            <h3>First Empty Birthday</h3>
            <p>
                I honestly hadn’t thought much, before a few weeks ago, about my birthday coming, this time without Marisa around. It had crossed my mind, but I have never had big birthday feelings. Grief will always hit you when you least expect it. That’s a conclusion I have come to. The days leading up to my birthday were full of emotion, tears, and deep empty hurt. Something would trigger my feelings of emptiness and I would be lost in a hurt that started in my heart and sank to the lowest part of my stomach. I don’t know how to describe the helplessness I felt. I  didn’t know what to do with myself other than simply to sit on my floor and cry. I looked through pictures and read through old cards and letters with Marisa’s bunny in my lap. How could I deal with this pain I was experiencing?  Maybe I should go to her memorial bench outside my parents', or maybe to the last place we went to together, or maybe to the lagoon. I ended up staying at my home. The realization that the hurt doesn’t change with my location, hit me hard. No one and nothing can change the raw, deep, empty pain.<br/><br/> 
                It’s crazy to think how many months have passed without her.  This first birthday of mine celebrated without her by my side hit me hard.   I don't know why some dates are tougher than others.  There is no predicting how I will feel or how I will cope. <br/><br/>
                Growing up together, the years between our ages seemed so small. As we became our own independent humans, our differences were more defined, but as kids, we were often mistaken for twins. I was a small build for sure but maybe it was our red hair that made us so similar. Who knows?   You tell me,  Marisa absolutely loved this misconception.  I suppose it was the idea that people thought she was two years older than she was. She hated being "the baby", so sharing that role would have been exhilarating for her.  Marisa was easy to bug. Being teased about being the youngest always put her up in arms. Oh, how I miss that voice she would raise in protest.   I miss you Marisa. <br/><br/>
                As Marisa would say, always be kind and remember to smile.<br/><br/>
