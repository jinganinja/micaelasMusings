            <h3>Code Blue</h3>
            <p>
                It was September 8, 2019. Marisa was at Royal Jubilee Hospital (RJH) alone. Mom had been staying with her, but had gone home the night before to try to get some rest. <br/><br/>
                8:35am, Mom: Marisa coded, we are on our way to RJH.<br/><br/>
                8:35am, Me: What is coded?<br/><br/>
                8:35am, Mom: Heart attack<br/><br/>
                I remember the moments like it was yesterday. I messaged my brother, Travis, stopping to pick him up on our way to get our sister, Kelsey, before going to the hospital. I was terrified. <br/><br/>
                What if she was gone before I could hear her voice again or say goodbye?<br/><br/>
                "Hold on baby girl, please, just hold on."<br/><br/>
                With everything in me I wished she would still be with us when we arrived finally at the hospital. <br/><br/>
                Within 6 minutes of my mom sending that first message, my brother, Josh, who lived closest, was at the hospital with Marisa. Throughout Marisa’s time at the hospital we had set up a method of communication to ensure all family members were filled in and up to date. Josh, once at the hospital,  sent a voice message to our chat.  I was petrified at what might be said in that recording. I pressed play. <br/><br/>
                In that moment, I had no idea what the doctor in the voice message was trying to communicate. Listening to it now, it’s pretty clear, but at that moment, I couldn’t tell you the difference between my left and right hands. I was shaking - trying to keep my composure and failing. <br/><br/>
                Marisa had been given too many pain medications for her.  It was when the nurse walked into her room to check on her after the dose that she found Marisa blue.  Apparently, It was not a heart attack but her breathing had slowed and then stopped.<br/><br/>
                When Marisa awoke, she had no idea what had happened, except that she was in a lot of pain. <br/><br/>
                I remember seeing her as I walked into the room.  The rest feels like history. The family all gathered - Marisa was well loved by all 7 of her siblings and spouses of those married, 13 of her nieces and nephews, and of course her parents. <br/><br/>
                I think back to this moment and I still can’t compose myself. Marisa was  brave and strong. She fought without complaint and with many a “Hey!" to get our attention. I wish I could go back and  tell her how impressed I was (and am) with her strength.  Then again, I wish I could go back and tell her many things. <br/><br/>
                Mari, <br/><br/>
                You were the strongest woman I have ever met. You were courageous and brave. You took the battle in stride and won the hearts of everyone who watched and fought alongside you. I wish I had the opportunity to walk through the rest of life with you, but I know I have you in my heart and watching over me from up above. I love you baby girl, always and forever. <br/><br/>
                As Marisa would say, always be kind and remember to smile.<br/><br/>
