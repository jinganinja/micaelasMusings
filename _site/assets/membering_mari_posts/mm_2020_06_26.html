            <h3>I Have Been on a Boat at Sea</h3>
            <p>
                Today’s post is the most personal I’ve written publicly. The vulnerability scares me, but also puts me out there for someone who may feel the same way. Grief is a taboo topic. It makes the general public uncomfortable. I wish it didn’t.  I am going to speak as though I am blind to that discomfort.<br/><br/>
                My experience with grief has been an interesting path. I go through a variety of emotions: sadness, anger, guilt, fear, even joy, but the worst of them is when I feel nothing at all. Sometimes the interval between each emotion is in a matter of minutes. Sometimes it's weeks. Feeling nothing is like a blank page when you have a 20 page essay due tomorrow, or the moment you get home after breaking up with someone.  I hope to open your eyes and mind to the idea that your grieving experiences might be more similar to mine than you think. <br/><br/>
                Everyone experiences grief in a variety of situations. The loss of life is not required for the feelings of grief to appear. A very recent example is the impact COVID-19 has had on our world. At the beginning it was hard because we had to grieve the loss of our old life, our old ways.  As with  a breakup, we have to grieve our life with that person and relearn how to live life without them. Although the emotions and feelings aren’t identical, it puts grief, due to the loss of a loved one, in perspective. <br/><br/>
                Through the last six months, I have been on a boat at sea. <br/><br/>
                This boat takes on storms at a moment’s notice. It floats swiftly through the good days and keeps me safe during the less good days. There are ups and downs, but there’s also a lot of days of nothing. I am out at sea, no one in sight, nothing to do but exist and make it to tomorrow. Sometimes this is lonely. Sometimes I like that.<br/><br/>
                Each storm I face on my boat comes in a different form: rains of emotion, triggers like lightning, words that feel like the sharp sting of hail on my face, and wind ever ready to blow me over. I am still here a-float, but the storms have had a large effect on my boat, my being, my essence. <br/><br/>
                Through the last six months, I have been on a boat at sea.<br/><br/>
                If you know someone on a boat at sea, realize you cannot take away the rain or the wind, but you can act as lighting or hail. You can trigger the storm. Your words (or lack thereof), can sting. Your actions (or lack thereof) can shock a being amidst their storm. Introspection, I believe, is one of our greatest skills. Can you use my words and go inward?  Reflect on interactions with others - interactions that build up and those that cause pain. <br/><br/>
                Although, there are many ways to negatively affect someone’s trip at sea, there are also many positive ones. Rays of sunshine can be plentiful and unique. Ask, and be ready to listen. Validate others’ feelings. Everyone is different. Everyone grieves differently. Be someone's needed ray of sunshine, not the sting of hail on their face or the shock lightning in their storm. <br/><br/>
                I hope you have picked up something from the vague references I have made. <br/>
                I hope you see that I am still on my boat out at sea. I have many storms to come.<br/>
                I hope you grasp more now than a few minutes ago when you started reading.<br/>
                I hope you go inward and ask yourself, "How can I be someone’s ray of sunshine?"<br/><br/>
                As Marisa would say, always be kind and remember to smile.
